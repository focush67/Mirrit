This is a social media application made with NextJS 14, TypeScript and MongoDB.

## Brief Overview

The application supports users for posting their day to day activities as posts to the application and supports full posts' interactions. Users can like, comment and save a given post. It also supports relationships, meaning that users can follow other users. Also upon interacting with the post, a realtime notification alert goes to the owner of the target post and contains the information of the user who interacted with the post. Users can also add to their story, and other people can like the stories of all other users.

The application also supports realtime chat as well as complex group chat features where users can create their personalized groups and other users can generate a group joining request and on approval, the user is added to the group. The application is completely responsive and adheres to the best practises, including SSR (Server Side Rendering) and Server Actions. Also the application is completely responsive on all majorly used devices, including mobile devices as well.
